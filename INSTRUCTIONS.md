## Overview

You have been given a project that is **not in a working state**.  
Several issues prevent it from compiling, starting, or behaving as described.

Your task is to identify and fix these issues so the application works correctly.

## The Problem
- The project does not compile or start successfully
- Some features do not work as expected

## Your Goal

Make the application work according to the README documentation:

1. Compile without errors
2. Start successfully
3. All documented API endpoints respond as expected

## Getting Started

1. Try to run the project
2. Read the error messages carefully
3. Fix the issues step by step

## Notes

- Focus on fixing the existing issues so the application works as described.
- You do not need to add new features or refactor unrelated code.
